## How to Contribute in it

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/FunTime-A_Social_Media_Platform.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the FunTime-A_Social_Media_Platform repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd FunTime-A_Social_Media_Platform
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git switch -c add-alonzo-church
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open any file in a text editor, make neccessary changes to it. Don't add unnecessary cahnges. Now, save the file.

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add <all files you changed one by one>
```
Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Explain what you added or improved"
```



## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.


## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/submit-pull-request.png" alt="submit pull request" />

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the main branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
